# views

add application views here. note, a view doesnâ€™t need to be present if the controller outputs the resulting view; e.g. the classes used by the controller return the html need by the web page and no further html is needed. when needed, you can create a corresponding view similar to a controller file.

* /projects/index.view.php corresponds with http://mysite.com/projects or http://mysite.com/projects/
* /projects/current.view.php corresponds with http://mysite.com/projects/current
